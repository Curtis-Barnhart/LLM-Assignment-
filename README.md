## How To

First, make sure that you have valid [OpenAI API keys](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).

Craig is a really simple tool to use. Just run 

```
python main.py file.txt
```

from the terminal, where file.txt is the path to your inventory. 
Since our tool makes use of OpenAI's ChatGPT
API you must also provide a valid API key to make the necessary API calls. 

## Data Format Requirements

In order to use Craig your inventory data must be formatted correctly. 
It expects inventory data to be a plain text file with items 
separated by a horizontal line in Markdown ('---'). 


Example: 

```
